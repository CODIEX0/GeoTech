Crop Selection: Choose crops that thrive in mild temperatures (15°C - 25°C) and can tolerate some drought. Consider planting drought-resistant crops like maize, beans, or squash.
Soil Management: Maintain soil health by adding organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil structure and water retention.
Pest and Disease Management: Keep an eye out for pests and diseases that thrive in dry conditions, such as spider mites, aphids, and powdery mildew.
Harvest Planning: Plan harvests according to crop maturity dates, taking into account the mild temperatures and dry soil conditions.
