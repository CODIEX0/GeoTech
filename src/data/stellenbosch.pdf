Advice:
Irrigation: Due to the lack of precipitation, irrigation is necessary to maintain optimal soil moisture levels. Monitor soil moisture closely and adjust irrigation schedules accordingly.
Crop Selection: Choose crops that thrive in mild temperatures (15°C - 25°C) and can tolerate some drought. Consider planting drought-resistant crops like maize, beans, or squash.
Soil Management: Maintain soil health by adding organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil structure and water retention.
Pest and Disease Management: Keep an eye out for pests and diseases that thrive in dry conditions, such as spider mites, aphids, and powdery mildew.
Harvest Planning: Plan harvests according to crop maturity dates, taking into account the mild temperatures and dry soil conditions.

Additional Tips:
Consider implementing conservation agriculture practices to reduce soil disturbance and retain soil moisture.
Monitor soil temperature and adjust planting dates accordingly to optimize germination and growth.
Keep an eye on weather forecasts to anticipate and prepare for potential heatwaves or cold snaps.
